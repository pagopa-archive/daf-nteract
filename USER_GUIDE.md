# nteract

nteract is a literate coding environment that supports Python, R, JavaScript and other [Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages). It wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook and embeds it as a desktop application. Now, you can open notebooks natively on your system. Double-click on a .ipynb file to open and begin using the notebook. It Just Works™

## Installation

To get started, download the latest [release](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/releases) for your OS.
